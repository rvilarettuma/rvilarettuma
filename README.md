# I'm Richard 👋!

### About me
I'm an avid tabletop/video gamer, tech enthusiast, and IT guy.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a homelab and create accessible, responsive, mobile-first PWA's
- 🐸 Graphic design is my passion (I am ACA certified in PhotoShop CS6 to make poor memes)
- 🥭 Fun fact: I would absolutely accept payments in Mango based drinks
